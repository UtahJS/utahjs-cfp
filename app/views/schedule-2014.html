			<h4>Stateful AJAX Authentication Without Server-side Sessions</h4>
			<p>Standard web applications handle authentication with server side sessions and cookies. That works fine until you hit scale, at which point storing those sessions becomes difficult, as does routing through load balancers to the right server cluster that handled your earlier requests. We&#x27;ll discover a secure way to store that information on the client without exposing API keys, while retaining control of session expiration, that will work with any front-end or backend configurations. While the reasons for doing this are complex, the actual implementation is something that even beginner JS developers will be able to comprehend and implement.

			<h4>What JavaScript Developers Need to Learn from the 60s</h4>
			<p>The 1960&#x27;s were ripe with valuable lessons in functional programming style. Many of us have forgotten these important lessons, but they&#x27;re making a come back in modern software development. And for good reasons: maintainability, testability, reuse, and performance. Come hop in the time machine as we apply historical lessons to modern software.

			<h4>Introduction to AngularJS</h4>
			<p>AngularJS is one of the most popular frontend frameworks. If you haven’t yet heard of it, prepare to be amazed. In Intro to AngularJS we’ll be doing an interactive workshop to learn the fundamental principles of AngularJS including:<br>1. Templates/Expressions - Your DOM structure<br>2. Module - Your app&#x27;s namespace<br>3. Directives - How you talk to the DOM<br>4. Filters - Utilities for what&#x27;s displayed to the user<br>5. Scope - What on earth is this thing!?<br>6. Controllers - The scope initializer<br>7. Services - Common utilities<br>8. Working with third-party modules<br>9. Firebase &amp; AngularFire - Going from two way binding, to three way binding. A full web application with no server setup required!<br><br>We&#x27;ll be following through a repository hosted on GitHub. There’s a branch for each concept, so you can play around with the code and then catch right back up with the next branch. So come on, and let’s learn AngularJS!

			<p>I am Kent C. Dodds. I work at Domo Technologies, Inc as a frontend developer working with AngularJS primarily. I recently graduated from BYU with a Master of Information Systems degree. I gave this talk twice at BYU with Firebase as a sponsor and had a ton of fun and a lot of attendees (the last one had 50 people). I love talking with people about code. I&#x27;ve spoken at several meet ups, but never a conference, so I&#x27;d love to speak at my first conference here in Utah!

This talk is targeted to anyone who&#x27;s new to AngularJS or would like an overview of the framework in general. So it&#x27;s for beginner or experienced devs who fall under that category. Thanks!

			<h4>PhoneGap &amp; Ionic</h4>
			<p>HabitRPG is full-stack JS (AngularJS, Node.js, MongoDB) - including the mobile app, which is AngularJS on PhoneGap. ~80% of the mobile app&#x27;s codebase is a HabitRPG common lib, which makes cross-platform maintenance a breeze (fix website bugs &amp; get those fixes on mobile for free, etc). We started with Topcoat.io on PhoneGap, which sucks. We&#x27;re converting to Ionic, which rocks. It bundles angular / angular-ui-router with some touch-nav goodness, plus a mobile UI framework which automatically handles the different devices (iOS &amp; Android). <br><br>So the topic: (1) taking full-stack JS to mobile, (2) Ionic

			<h4>Functional Javascript: The Good Parts</h4>
			<p>Functional programming encourages us to organize our code well and helps us create code that can be easier to reason about. The less we reinvent the wheel and use a well-tested tool, the easier it is to maintain our application code. <br><br>&quot;Pure&quot; functions return a result based only on what you pass in. You never have to worry it is going to do something unexpected. Higher order functions (functions that take other functions as parameters) let us reuse code in places we wouldn&#x27;t expect, like loops. Composition allows you to create larger tools from smaller ones. <br><br>Javascript is a great functional language, but some ideas are harder to implement than others, and some aren&#x27;t worth using in JS at all! After having wandered the Functional JS wastes for a few years, I will tell you stories of the dangers that lurk, as well as the rewards that await you if you apply Functional JS wisely.

			<h4>The Challenges of Large Single Page Applications</h4>
			<p>In the past 2 years I&#x27;ve helped design a large (+ 200k lines of JavaScript) single page application that is supposed to live and grow for the next 15+ years.<br>We had to overcome some serious technical hurdles to deliver the experience users demanded.  Users expect native desktop like performance and they use the single page app like a desktop application.  They log in to the app in the morning and leave the browser window open all day long.  We had to employ strategies such as intelligent session caching on the client, background loading data via web workers and server to client browser push to keep data up to date. I&#x27;d like to review the challenges and strategies / architecture that we used to overcome those challenges.

			<h4>i18n with AngularJS</h4>
			<p>i18n is a part of development that is often overlooked. While challenging to implement, when done properly i18n can drive more traffic to your site and provide more value to your users.<br><br>My talk will cover the following:<br><br>What is i18n and why is it important?<br><br>I am constantly surprised by how many developers don’t even know what i18n stands for. Beyond describing what i18n is, I will discuss the value that it can provide to your site and users.<br><br>How to detect locale<br><br>Before you can provide locale specific content, you need to know what locale your user prefers. I will show how this detection can be done.<br><br>Serving translated pages<br><br>If a user visiting your site only speaks french, but your site only serves pages in english they are not going to stick around beyond the first page. This has a negative impact on your business, especially if you offer a product or service they would otherwise be interested in, but they couldn’t read your site to find it. I will discuss how to serve translated pages with AngularJS.<br><br>Formatting data<br><br>Aside from translating text content, some data needs to be formatted differently based on locale. Specifically dates, numbers and currency. AngularJS provides filters to manage this for you. I will show how these filters are used.

			<h4>Slay the Undying: How to Delete Old Code</h4>
			<p>In any mature software project there are those blocks of code which no one dares touch.  You know the sort of code I&#x27;m talking about.  The files were coded by &quot;Steve&quot;, late one night before a release.  He kept himself awake by sniffing glue all night.  He promised to fix it later, but then he ended up in the penitentiary due to the aforementioned glue-sniffing.  Now you have 30,000 lines of spaghetti code that forms the core of your entire platform.<br><br>Eventually there comes a day when some brave soul needs to just roll up his sleeves and kill the code that will not die, once and for all.  That brave soul will no doubt be praised by their peers for their courageous deeds.  More importantly, that brave soul could be you.  Viper will provide some tried and true approaches to refactoring nasty, old code.  He will also provide suggestions on how to keep this code for developing in the first place.

			<h4>Do you REALLY know JavaScript?</h4>
			<p>As I talked about in my introduction, I&#x27;m very heavily involved in teaching JavaScript. Sadly, JavaScript usually isn&#x27;t traditionally taught at the University level. Although most engineers have experience with more traditional programming languages like C++ and Java, JavaScript as we know is quite different. With the rise of frameworks like Angular and Ember ( +many more), fundamental JavaScript programming is being abstracted away. This is bad, and we should feel bad. I&#x27;m amazed at the amount of engineers I see who don&#x27;t REALLY know what the &#x27;new&#x27; keyword does in JavaScript, or those who still aren&#x27;t confident about what &#x27;this&#x27; in JavaScript actually does. In my talk I&#x27;m hoping to kick it old school Crockford style. I&#x27;ll quickly talk the beginnings of JavaScript, then go straight into fundamentals. new, this, call, apply, bind, instantiation patterns, etc etc etc. If time permits, I&#x27;d love to cover the future of JavaScript as well comparing what we have now, to what&#x27;s going to change with ES6. I really love Angular, but the reason I love it is because I&#x27;m able to understand it from a vanilla JavaScript viewpoint, I&#x27;d like more people to experience that.

			<p>Ember.js is a powerful front end framework for developing sophisticated applications. Elasticsearch makes real time, scalable search painless. Put them together and you get powerful, scalable, buzzword awesomeness. We&#x27;ll briefly talk about setting up Nginx as a reverse proxy with CORS enabled to protect your Elasticsearch install and make your service available across domains. Then we&#x27;ll build an Ember application that takes advantage of our Elasticsearch installation.

			<h4>Practical Philosophy: Abstracting Away your Pain with JavaScript</h4>
			<p>An exploration from the fundamentals of computer science all the way up to implementing real time apps in just 8 lines of code. For most people, the latter would reek of assumption dependent frameworks, but we&#x27;ll discover how to apply some primitive philosophies to escape from that pain and keep full control instead. Yes, you can have your cake and eat it too, with elegant and maintainable code - you&#x27;ll laugh, you&#x27;ll cry, we&#x27;ll kill Socrates, and we&#x27;ll cook a Kraken. Just don&#x27;t bring popcorn, or it might burst the kernel into panic.

			<h4>Testing for the Absolute Beginner</h4>
			<p>I see you sitting there, zoning out when testing is discussed. You write code that works and you don&#x27;t need to test. Perhaps you don&#x27;t even know how to write a test. Or, even worse, you are intimidated by testing. How about we drop all the ceremony around tests and talk about the reality of tests.<br><br>Testing can be awesome and fun. But what is conceptually simple can take a lifetime to master. This presentation will lay a solid foundation of testing best practices and guide you through how to use tests to change how you think about your code.

			<h4>Build it better, faster, stronger</h4>
			<p>It&#x27;s Friday at 1am in the morning. You roll over to your night stand, flip on the light and write down the idea that just woke you up. It&#x27;s the best idea you&#x27;ve ever had. The next big thing. Tomorrow you&#x27;ll describe it to your friends as &quot;Think of Dollar Shave Club for Bacon but with a side of artisanal barrel aged hot sauce&quot;... you roll over and go back to sleep, dreaming of the ways it will change the world. You&#x27;re so excited you even set an alarm for the morning, for Saturday morning.<br><br>The blaring alarm wakes you up 5 hours later and you sit up in bed, grab your laptop, and ... yeah ...<br><br>Look the truth is you need this thing done fast, or you&#x27;ll lose your interest/job/motivation/significant other/mind. In this presentation we&#x27;ll talk about the tools you can use to speed up development, from using gulpjs, to deploying node apps to heroku, to creating project templates in yeoman, to styling tricks in CSS. This will be a fast and furious exploration of the tools you can use to build things even faster.<br><br>Vote for this presentation and all your dreams will definitely come true.

			<h4>About Isaac Strack</h4>
			<p>Linked in profile here: http://www.linkedin.com/in/strack/

I am a design technologist, currently working as a solutions consultant at Adobe. I have been with Adobe for 4 years, and was with eBay for 11 years prior to that, building trust &amp; safety MIS systems.  I have won multiple innovation and company awards over the years, including the very first Jeff Skoll community award. I have been named on a patent, am a published author ( Getting Started With Meteor.js JavaScript Framework), and am currently underway on a 2nd Meteor book, due out later this year.

I am particularly passionate about education and knowledge, especially when it comes to our youth. I believe that knowledge is the great equalizer; the gift anyone can give, and many can receive, to change lives for the better. I am on the founding board for the Wasatach Institute of Technology (WIT for short - http://wasatchinstitute.net ), Utah&#x27;s first computer science high school. I am on the STEAM team at Adobe (STEM + Arts = STEAM), working with the larger tech community in Utah on various STEM / STEAM initiatives to better the lives of our children. My latest effort is heading up the WIT Hour of Code on May 17th -- The largest, awesomest celebration of technology and STEM education in the state: http://bit.ly/wit-hoc 

I spoke at the UtahJS conference last year (How To Date JavaScript) and would love the opportunity again this year. Thanks for considering me!

			<h4>Teaching browsers how to fish, or... offline storage is really really cool</h4>
			<p>They say if you give a browser data it&#x27;s fed for the moment, but if you teach it how to store it&#x27;s own data you lower your download size substantially. <br><br>Ok, so they probably don&#x27;t say that because it&#x27;s long and not very catchy. Still, it&#x27;s very true in this world of throttled bandwidth, EDGE networks, data limits, flaky connections, and internet fast lanes.<br><br>This presentation will look at the options we have for offline storage in the browser, a library for dealing with them seamlessly (localforage), and some of the crazy ways that you can optimize download size with an offline first mentality. Because, with the rise of WebSQL, AccessDB and localStorage, we can store all sorts of cool stuff in the browser and then render them out without talking to the server at all.

			<h4>Open Source is Best Practice</h4>
			<p>When writing software we decide where to put code a hundred times a day. Usually the easiest place to drop it is the hardest to maintain, but it&#x27;s not always obvious what to do. @substack once said something like: &quot;Whenever I approach a problem I think: what tools, if they existed would make this problem trivial?&quot; Using open source means you don&#x27;t have to reinvent the wheel, and it reduces the complexity of your application code. <br><br>But what about when the library you need doesn&#x27;t exist? This talk centers on the idea that we should think of our applications as a small amount of application code pulling together many well-designed open source libraries. We all benefit from more well-designed open source, but even if your team never publishes anything, if you extract all the generic parts of your application into focused libraries, your code base will end up well-factored by default. <br><br>We will also discuss good design principles for open source libraries, the tools available to us to make it easier, and why it is a good business decision too.

			<h4>Conflict Resolution with Guns</h4>
			<p>Gun is a distributed, embedded graph engine that replaces the need for traditional (SQL or NoSQL) databases. It is incredibly lightweight and fast, being a cache that has a persistence layer - otherwise known as a NoDB. This talk will go over the interesting algorithms that allow for an eventually consistent peer to peer system with Gun, even if the nodes in the network are far apart or separated by significant latency. It is a preview into the far future, when developers will have users living in colonies on Mars that want to collaborate with other users back on Earth - yet is still applicable to apps of today that demand synchronization be built in, as is the case for any developer that has had to deal with concurrent writes to their database.

			<h4>Typescript is testing made easy</h4>
			<p>Typescript is a minimal superset of Javascript that adds a modern type system and ES6 features. <br><br>Testing your code has never been more popular. It prevents you or other people on your team from breaking things that already work. Most importantly, it gives you the confidence to edit and refactor legacy code. However, testing is difficult. We must maintain tests, they are difficult to write, and they are slow to write and slow to run. Strict typing gives your Javascript similar benefits but is much easier to implement. It&#x27;s like putting your tests inline with your code while you write it. You can see your mistakes inline every time you save. <br><br>Typescript adds a modern type system to Javascript that is 20 years better than Java. It doesn&#x27;t get in your way, and allows you to catch many complex errors. It&#x27;s extremely easy to add to your project since everything is optional and all JS is valid. It compiles to clean, semantic Javascript. It also adds a few ES6 features like imports, fat-arrow functions, and classes. <br><br>In this presentation I will show what it is like to work with Typescript on a real project and how easy it is to implement.

Canvas gets a lot of attention from game developers, but it can be a great tool for any web software that employs rich visuals.<br><br>I&#x27;ll walk you through the feature set available through HTML5 canvas, best practices for getting great-looking output, and how to get the best performance possible.

			<h4>Ending the async debate: ES6 Generators</h4>
			<p>I recently had the chance to play around with Koa.js, a node server-side framework that introduced me to the subject of ES6 generators. They solve Javascript&#x27;s async problem very nicely and they&#x27;re just around the corner. They are currently supported in Node 0.11, Firefox 26 and Chrome 29. <br><br>Generators allow you to write special functions that can yield control to the outside. They are useful for iterators, async, and many other things too. When used together with promises they allow you to write sequential async code completely naturally, as if it were synchronous. <br><br>We will compare Javascript async patterns, including the callback pyramid of doom, promises, and finally using promises with generators.

I gave this talk twice at BYU with Firebase as a sponsor and had a ton of fun and a lot of attendees (the last one had 50 people). I love talking with people about code. I&#x27;ve spoken at several meet ups, but never a conference, so I&#x27;d love to speak at my first conference here in Utah!

			<h4>JavaScript for people who would rather not learn JavaScript</h4>
			<p>I love JavaScript. You probably don&#x27;t. I won&#x27;t judge. This is the most brief introduction to how to not JavaScript: the bare minimum you need to know in a world where JavaScript exists and ES5 is sometimes your only option.<br><br>&quot;It&#x27;s important to know JavaScript if you&#x27;re going to do anything with programming - on a server, the web, a mobile device, Arduino, probably even Windows has it by now. If it runs code, it probably runs JavaScript&quot;<br><br>JavaScript is asynchronous. You need to understand that. I will show you. You will then be happy and find true peace.<br><br>:-)
